Finding torrent sites that are accessible, downloadable, and reasonably safe is becoming harder each year in mainland China. Many torrent sites are either blocked or overloaded with intrusive ads. Worse, some resources may be fake or malicious.

If you're facing these issues, don't worry. We've compiled a 2025 list of reliable, active, resource-rich, and user-friendly torrent sites. Each site below has been selected based on availability, content breadth, community activity, and usability.

Besides site recommendations, this guide also introduces several useful torrent clients. Using the right tools together will give you a better experience. If you want to find resources stably over the long term, reduce ad interference, and improve download success rates, this guide will help.

## Tools you need to access torrent sites in China

In mainland China, a browser alone is usually not enough to access many popular torrent sites because most are blocked. Direct access often fails or takes a long time to load.

Additionally, when downloading torrents Chinese users should protect privacy and security. Torrenting can be tracked; if your IP is exposed you may face monitoring or unwanted attention.

There are many VPN and proxy tools on the market, but for torrent downloads you should choose services with unlimited bandwidth, stable speeds, and P2P support. Also, avoid free or shady VPNs that may throttle traffic or inject ads.

* **ExpressVPN**: Very stable and fast, high security. From $4.99/month, 30-day trial. (affiliate link)
* **StrongVPN**: Longstanding VPN, reliable and affordable, from $3.97/month, supports Alipay.

These two have good reputations in mainland China for stability, speed, and device compatibility.
